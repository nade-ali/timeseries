Time series analyses using ARIMA and LSTM. Coded in Python. The data used here is the Waves dataset from Jan 2017 to June 2019, available on the Queensland Government website. As per the official description, it includes “data collected by oceanographic wave measuring buoys anchored at Mooloolaba.” 

The comparison was essentially between a bidirectional LSTM and ARIMA model with parameters (1,1,1). The data was already normalized before the models were run, hence why the ARIMA parameters were set as such.
